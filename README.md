# Shinobi CCE 

### Origin

[Shinobi](https://shinobi.video/) is an Open Source CCTV Solution written by Moe Alam. Originally licensed under GPLv3, it was split into the Pro and Community Edition versions in 2018. The development continued on the Pro version under different license, while Community Edition code (that retained GPLv3) would only receive bug fixes and occasional big merges. See [this](https://hub.shinobi.video/articles/view/QDD2cqvbTekzhar) for more details on the split.

Originally hosted on Github, Shinobi official repo got [moved](https://hub.shinobi.video/articles/view/KAgVFFNBDiamauW) to Gitlab in the same 2018. This fork is based on the lates Github commit and incorporates [changes](https://gitlab.com/Shinobi-Systems/ShinobiCE/-/commits/master), made to the Community Edition after the move. Keep in mind, that even with all available security updates merged, it is not recommended to expose this version to the internet.
